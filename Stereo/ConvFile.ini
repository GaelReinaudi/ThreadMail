Hey Amol, 

thanks for a great discussion yesterday. 
We'll certainly have more questions about the details of our involvement, but to start it sounds like you've got a great idea in the works, and we'd love to be a part of it !
Count us in

Gael & Chris
*****Amol-----
Awesome. Send me stuff like your past work/cv/github/ greatest hits

*****Gael-----
Hi,
Chris is away and unreachable for the week.

My cv is attached.

About the section "Framework for controlling laboratory experiments" of my cv.
Perhaps one of the most relevant points about my work might be that I addressed the problem of "coding in labs". Scientist have poor coding skills, and don't even know the basic tools or concept necessary to organize their work (like version control). As a result, software developed in this context is usually not reusable, not extendable, or even not maintainable. My approach to the problem was to code a framework, LabExe, that would allow scientist to concentrate on the very specific thing they need to code, while preventing them from trying to reinvent the (square) wheel over and over. Very much like anyone can code an app for the iPhone without caring or knowing about what makes the iOS so friendly.

Anyway, I could go on but Chris and I already summarized some of that in a Google Doc "A new paradigm in scientific software for laboratories", http://goo.gl/FSzzj.
It is at the third person "Dr, Reinaudi" because it was originally written for my green card application (which was approved).
Also, the 2 links in the doc (http://goo.gl/chFYJ and http://goo.gl/uxjo4) are videos that we made respectively when I tried to put the app for download on a windows app-store, and to illustrate our scientific article about the evolutionary-optimization of a lab device, http://goo.gl/GnxAd (the genetic optimizer being one of the 30+ plugins of the software).

You have already seen some of Basalt... 
By the way, none of the code mentioned above is on GitHub, but on a private server of ours and it would be easy to show you some code. 

Other details that might be relevant:
- a passion for neural network. machine learning and evolutionary optimization,
- very much connecting with the "Lean Startup" paradigm,
- a love for hacking things, from a closed door, to a coffee machine, a flying robot, or code.

If you are looking for other details, don't hesitate to ask me.
Cheers,
Gael

Cool. Wow those are some geeky gadgets in your videos. They are
physics instruments?

What about a screencast of Basalt? That's the relevant project!!

*****Gael-----
We are actually working on it. There would be a lot to say about a Basalt screencast, things that would/will make it stand out from other videos.

Yes those are devices we use in the lab, but they are usually meant for individual that love geeky automation/robots: www.phidgets.com. One of the plugin I made happen to allow the control of those devices. Another plugin manages the camera.

*****Amol-----
No, no, you NEED a quick screencast (not as nice as what you made on
Vimeo) that just lets me show my colleagues what you are capable of.
The vimeos you have up are not relevant. Maybe you show me the Basalt
screencast (use jing.com to just capture your screen while you play
with it a bit).

*****Chris----
Hi Amol, I am sailing with family and have very limited internet access. I will be back noontime on Monday and we can get you these various resources, including my CV/etc.

Very excited to discuss the details and move forward. Talk to you soon.

*****Amol-----
Ok!

*****Amol-----
Gael - can you make a screencast of Basalt in action using something
like Jing for Windows ?

*****Gael-----
Hi Amol,
Jing looks like a great tool, thanks for the link. I will wait Chris for that because anyway I am currently working on a few things on Basalt (on a different branch of the code).

The lab software developed in the lab is a pretty good demonstration of capabilities. It is extremely challenging to write a framework that exposes a clean API so that users can easily code plugins within the intended scope. 
Next time we meet I can make a quick demonstration which will be much more impressive than a video since this is how you take a grasp at the endless possibilities provided by such a structure. 

I guess the same thing could be said about Basalt but I should probably add this; what you saw of Basalt almost a year ago was demonstrating most of the concept we are developing. Still, what was kept under the hood at that time was two-fold:
- First, having an unlimited number of “permanently opened” files in our 2D space raises a great deal of complexity for implementation. You cannot just open all the files in the RAM (like it was the case one year ago for the demonstration). We had to switch the hierarchy of the program a few times before understanding what was the right structure. Anyway it is now working smoothly in the way it is supposed to (with tens of thousands of items).
- Second, and maybe more importantly, we have thought a lot about the type of features that would make Basalt spread among potential users and what would make it appear sexy for companies (marketing-wise). 

About Knotable, I was wondering a bit what was the status of it. You clearly exposed a cool idea and some mockups, but do you think you could shed some light on a few points:
- what is the status on the team, since you mentioned your colleagues in your email,
- is the funding planned already? 
- what kind of role would you have in mind for us? 
Maybe it is too early to answer precisely those questions but we would be even interested about what you currently have in mind on those subjects. 
There are so many different ways to join at an early stage, and all are not equivalent or with the same amount of perspective. As a matter of fact, and I am sure you agree with this, I think this is even the first thing to clarify. 

We are very much looking forward to hearing from you,
Gael

*****Amol-----
I would be glad to tell you all. We can chat today. But I want a screencast of basalt :) If you protect it so much from a private and friendly viewing, what will you be like in a real startup where we must build and ship continuously?

*****Gael-----
Hey Amol, 
Fair enough! It would be hard to refute the diagnosis of a little motherly protection, :) especially if we have nothing ready to ship yet and haven't had a chance yet to meet your colleagues. 
About the "agile" development paradigm, I am totally on that page, but isn't it a very different situation?

But really I promised Chris that we could get started on this project with you together. 
What's your time frame? Chris comes back on Monday.

By the way, sorry I couldn't answer yesterday, I was being interviewed for 8 straight hours.
Looking forward to talking to you on the phone,

Gael

*****Amol----
That's cool - let's chat when Chris is back. We aren't starting
anything. I am just wanting to persuade my cofounder that we should be
talking to a couple of zany physics guys! :)

*****Amol-----
You guys back Monday? Let's meet in Soho at Fon which is 39 wooster
street. Maybe like 330pm?

*****Gael-----
Hi Amol,
Chris arrives around midday tomorrow. 
It would be better to meet in the evening or on Tuesday.

*****Amol-----
Evening could be good. 630-730 at Oracle Club?  theoracleclub.com in
LIC is about 25 min from Times Square. 10 min on train and 5 from the
Vernon-Jackson stop

*****Chris-----
Hey Amol, we can do this evening at Oracle Club. We can leave here at 6 earliest, so we might be there closer to 7. Is that ok?

Thanks so much for your patience this week while I was out of town. We're looking forward to chatting.

And here's my resume. (The fonts look best in in chrome/safari)

*****Amol-----
Awesome. See you at 7
